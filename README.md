### Proposed Improvement

To enhance the accuracy of head pose estimation, I implemented a key modification in the data sampling strategy during model training:

#### Gaussian Sampling vs. Random Sampling

- **Problem**: Random sampling often introduces noise and uneven distribution across the pose space, resulting in poor generalizationâ€”especially at extreme yaw/pitch angles.
- **Solution**: Replaced random sampling with **Gaussian distribution sampling**, concentrating more samples around common pose ranges while still covering edge cases.
- **Result**:
  - **Significant RMSE improvement** (up to ~20% reduction) over random sampling.
  - Model learns a more structured representation of head pose, resulting in better generalization to real-world data.

#### Lightweight Model Retained

- Model size remains only **~0.66MB**.
- No complex or deep backbone used.
- Optimized for edge deployment and real-time applications.
