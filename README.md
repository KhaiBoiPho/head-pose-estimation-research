### Proposed Improvement

To enhance the accuracy of head pose estimation, I focused on improving the **reference image sampling strategy** during model training.  

#### Gaussian Sampling vs. Random Sampling  

**Problem**  
- Random sampling of reference images often leads to noisy and uneven distribution across the pose space.  
- This causes weak generalization, especially at extreme yaw and pitch angles.  

**Solution**  
- Introduced **Gaussian-based sampling** instead of uniform random selection.  
- Sampling is centered around the yaw angle of the input image.  
- A smaller number of samples are drawn from opposing angles to preserve diversity.  

**Findings**  
- Clear accuracy improvement under both **Protocol 1** and **Protocol 2**.  
- Best results achieved with **Ïƒ = 30**.  
- Combining **similar + contrasting yaw angles** yields better generalization than using only the closest angles.  

**Conclusion**  
- A balanced **Gaussian sampling strategy** ensures the model learns both:  
  - **Proximity** â†’ captures important similarities.  
  - **Diversity** â†’ incorporates contrasting orientations.  
- This significantly improves fine-grained head pose estimation performance.

### Lightweight Model Retained  

- Model size remains only **~0.66MB**.  
- No deep or heavy backbone introduced.  
- Fully optimized for **real-time, edge deployment** scenarios (e.g., AR/VR, driver monitoring).
